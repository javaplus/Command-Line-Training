# Command-Line-Training


We will be going through the LinkedIn learning video training on Learning the Linux Command Line.  You first need to follow this guide to install WSL 2: [Windows Subsystem for Linux].   
We will be using **Ubuntu on Windows** running in the **Windows Subsytem for Linux** (WSL) for our training.    

Once you have Ubuntu on Windows with WSL 2 setup, you can open a terminal to be ready to follow along with the video training.  

**NOTE:** Your environment/file system will not be exactly like you see in the video. You will not have all the folders and files you see in the video presentation, but this is expected as different environments are commonly slightly different.  If you followed our setup guide above, you have the Documents and Exercise Files copied into your home directory, so as the video uses them you are prepared.  
One other difference in the video is the way they get to the terminal. When the video starts to talk about how to open a terminal using the Activities option, just ignore it.  To open the terminal on windows: Hit your windows key on the keyboard or click the windows icon and then type "Ubuntu". If you have WSL 2 with Ubuntu installed you'll see an option for "Ubuntu on Windows". Click it to open an Ubuntu bash terminal.  Do this now so you have a terminal open and ready to follow along.

General Note on the video training.  Don't just watch and listen to the videos, but follow along... try out the commands as you watch the video.  And when you get to the **"Challenge:"** sections, pause the video and try each challenge.  The commands and skills you learn in this training **WILL BE FOUNDATIONAL** to much of what you do throughout your career as a software developer.  **YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE** for learning the skills to help you thrive and be an amazing dev!  So, take advanatage of this opportunity to learn these valuable skills by practicing and playing with it as you go.


Oh man the anticipationg is killing me  :grimacing: ... OK let's just dive in...
